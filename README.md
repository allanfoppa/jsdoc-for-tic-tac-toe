# JSDOC FOR TIC TAC TOE

## MOTIVATION

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) application demonstrating the use of JSDoc for code documentation and React for building a user interface. It implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to showcase how these technologies can be combined effectively.

## THANK YOU

The React.dev Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial [game link](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) is indeed a valuable resource for learning how to build React applications.
