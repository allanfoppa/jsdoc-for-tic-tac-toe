Includes its origins in ancient Egypt, its evolution through the Roman Empire, and its eventual name change:

Origins

The earliest evidence of tic-tac-toe is from 1300 BCE, when 3x3 game boards were found on roofing tiles in Egypt.

Roman Empire

In the first century BC, the Romans played a similar game called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) on a three-by-three grid. Players moved their three pebbles around to empty spaces.

Name changes

The British name for the game was "noughts and crosses", which was first printed in 1858. The name "tic-tac-toe" was first used in 1884 to describe a children's game where players threw a pencil at a slate with numbers and scored the numbers they hit. The name "tic-tac-toe" is thought to come from the sound the pencil made when it hit the slate.

Video game

In 1952, British computer scientist Alexandar S. Douglas developed one of the first video games, a version of tic-tac-toe.

Tinkertoy computer

In 1975, MIT students used a Tinkertoy computer to create a perfect tic-tac-toe game. The game is now on display at the Museum of Science in Boston.

Other games similar to tic-tac-toe include

- Three men's morris: A game played on a simple grid where players need three pieces in a row to win
